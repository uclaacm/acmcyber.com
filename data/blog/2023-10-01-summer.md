# Cyber Summer Project 2023: Detecting GDPR violations

I think it was back in May when Benson had first proposed the idea of doing a security project with the club over the summer. I was always interested in doing new things, so the idea appealed to me immediately. It took sometime to decide on the topic, but eventually we decided to do something in the field of detecting GDPR violations and that privacy and security were "close enough". The plan was to eventually submit our project to some conferences, namely the MIT URTC.

Unfortunately, a couple issues were apparently immediately. One was that since UCLA ends later than most colleges and we would only start once finals were over, we would have very little time to actually complete our project if we wanted to make the conference deadline (~6 weeks). The other was that no one working on the project had actually done work with GDPR before. Fortunately, to help us with the latter Benson introduced us to now UTA professor Faysal Shezan. After talking with him for a bit, we began to finalize our plan. Faysal had recently written a paper that could detect GDPR violations in wordpress plugins (known as "CHKPLUG", check it out here: https://www.ndss-symposium.org/ndss-paper/chkplug-checking-gdpr-compliance-of-wordpress-plugins-via-cross-language-code-property-graph/), but it lacked application for an everyday user. Our goal was to utilize it by first scraping the wordpress plugins from a website for the program to analyze. This way, we could automate the whole process of detecting violations in a website. 

But what if the website didn't use wordpress? Only a little less than half of websites actually use wordpress, so this was a pretty reasonable concern. However, all websites do have a privacy policy, so our solution was to find a way we can analyze a privacy policy for any privacy violations. (This also means we would have to trust the word of the website's policy, which is why this part was more of a "backup") This general process can be seen in the following figure. ![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/H1HZrUPxp.png)

Now it's time to start coding. The goal was to create a program that given only the URL of a website could perform a thorough analysis of it, that way it would be easy to integrate this program into a browser extension. I first decided to work on the wordpress section of the program. This meant that I first needed a way to scrape the wordpress plugins that a website uses. Thankfully, plugins are statically loaded into a website so all I needed to do was download the HTML and parse it with BeautifulSoup.
```python
def parse_plugins(url: str) -> set:
    req = requests.get(url)
    plugins = set()
    soup = BeautifulSoup(req.text, 'html.parser')
    all = soup.find_all(True)
    for tag in all:
        for attr in tag.attrs:
            content = tag[attr]
            if type(content) == type([]):
                for c in content:
                    split = c.split("wp-content/plugins/")
                    if len(split) > 1:
                        plugins.add(split[1].partition("/")[0])
                continue
            split = content.split("wp-content/plugins/")
            if len(split) > 1:
                plugins.add(split[1].partition("/")[0])
    # do we have a source that says only scripts and links contain plugins?
    # links = soup.find_all('link', attrs={'href': True})
    # scripts = soup.find_all('script', attrs={'src': True})
    # for link in links:
    #     split = link['href'].split("wp-content/plugins/")
    #     if len(split) > 1:
    #         plugins.add(split[1].partition("/")[0])
    # for script in scripts:
    #     split = script['src'].split("wp-content/plugins/")
    #     if len(split) > 1:
    #         plugins.add(split[1].partition("/")[0])
    return plugins
```
I couldn't find a source that wordpress plugins could only be referenced through scripts and links, so I ended up having to parse through all elements to look for it. Once we've gotten the name of all the plugins, we then had to download the plugin's files for analysis. 

An issue arised when the name listed in the website's source didn't match the name in wordpress's listing (For example, instead of *pluginname* it would be *pluginname-pro*). This would mean we wouldn't be able to directly enter the url of the plugin's download page. To compensate for this, I decided to use wordpress's search function to find the plugin closest to the name that we found in the website. Unfortunately, their search page is dynamically loaded. So to automate this, I decided to use selenium. Once we found the plugin's download page, all we had to do we search for the download link. 
```python
def get_download(plugin: str) -> str:
    link = f"https://wordpress.org/plugins/{plugin}/"
    req = requests.get(link)
    if len(req.history) != 0:
        search = f"https://wordpress.org/search/{plugin}/"

        driver = webdriver.Chrome(service=Service(ChromeDriverManager().install()))
        driver.get(search)
        link = driver.find_element("xpath", "//a[@class='gs-title']")
        link = (link.get_attribute("href"))
    req = requests.get(link)
    soup = BeautifulSoup(req.text, "html.parser")
    download = soup.find("a", attrs={'class':"plugin-download button download-button button-large"})
    return download['href']
```

After this, we simply unzip the downloaded files and run CHKPLUG on it.

Next we had to work on the privacy policy analysis portion. First, I tried to find a way to get the privacy policy's URL. Inspired by a paper I read (https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3559613.3563195), I decided to use a search engine API, which in my case was Google's. My methodology was to use the domain name with the words privacy policy appended to it. I also took advange of google's "exact match" field to only return searches that had terms such as "privacy" (basically a simple form of google dorking, maybe there's a better dork to be used). After testing this method on a few website's, I decided that it seemed to work fine and moved on. 

The issue now was that we needed to get the privacy policy in plaintext, but the website's only had them in HTML. Fortunately, we found a tool online that could do this exact text for us (https://github.com/benandow/HtmlToPlaintext). So now all we had to do was find a way to evaluate this plaintext. 
```python
def getpolicyurl(url: str) -> str:
    dommame = "https://" + url.split("https://")[1].split("/")[0]
    q = f"{dommame}%20privacy policy"
    query = f"{ENDPOINT}&exactTerms=privacy&q={q}"
    resp = requests.get(query)
    jresp = json.loads(resp.text)
    return jresp["items"][0]['link']

def gethtml(url: str) -> str:
    driver = webdriver.Chrome(service=Service(ChromeDriverManager(version="114.0.5735.90").install()))
    driver.get(url)
    text = driver.find_element("tag name", "body").get_attribute("innerHTML")
    return text
def parse(url: str) -> str:
    text = gethtml(getpolicyurl(url))
    with open("temp", "w", encoding="UTF-8") as f:
        f.write(text)
    pp = Preprocessor("temp")
    return "\n".join(pp.parse())
```
We decided early on to use machine learning for this task but was not sure what to do exactly. Eventually, Benson mentioned that huggingface could probably do this task pretty easily. If you don't know what huggingface is, it basically provides a bunch of tools for ML, including a bunch of pretrained transformers. Since pretrained transformers seem to be one of the cool new things right now, I thought it could be a good idea. I talked with Joshua about it and he went to work, using the dataset that we found in a previous paper. We were quickly able to achieve a model with an accuracy of over 80%, which was definitely not bad. 

After finishing both sections, we were left with less than a week to finish the paper for the conference. After a couple sleepless nights, we somehow managed to fit all our data and information into a document. So, in the end, I can proudly say that you will be able to find our paper in the proceedings for MIT URTC '23!
